**Dot Catcher**

This is a simple game designed for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 with an 8x8 RGB LED Matrix. Your objective is to move your "White" dot to catch the "Green" dots. As you progress, Red walls will appear, and "Yellow" enemies will show up on the board. Touching an enemy will result in a loss.

It is based on Demo Game example.
